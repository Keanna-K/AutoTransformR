}
\arguments{
\item{image_path}{string: The file path of the image to be translated.}

\item{num_images}{integer: The number of rotated images to be returned.}

\item{rotation}{integer: The maximum allowable rotation for any of the rotated images. Can be between 1 and 360.}
}
\value{
array: pixel values of the translated images
}
